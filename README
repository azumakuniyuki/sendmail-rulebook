    base maps from master sites.

* make targets of `Makefile'
    hostmap:
        Create the following database map files: the ppptable,the sendermt.

    check:
        Check whether or not  required files  which are defined  in the

rulebook
    The name list of sendmail features  for the control of each ruleset. It
    is the core database  of the sendmail-rulebook system.  It controls the 
    execution of the ruleset by using following RHS: ON/OFF/LOG/TEST/SCORE.
    This database map is defined at the lib_rulebook.m4, is referred in the
    isExecutable.

cctable
    The list of ISO-3166 Country Codes(A2 Codes).  It's useful to accept or
    reject connections by the country name (A2 Code) . This database map is
    referred in ccCtl ruleset.

dnszonetable
    The list of  DNS-Based Blocklist, Whitelist,  and IP GeoLocation zones. 
    The dnszonetable hold some LHSBLs (Left-Hand-Side Block lists, IP-Based
    Listing), RHSBLs (Right-Hand-Side Block Lists, Hostname-Based Listing),
    LHSWLs (White lists), and RHSWLs (White lists).  Ruleset dnszCtl, lhsbl 
    rhsbl and ccCtl refer this database map.

sendermt
    The sendermt is the mailertable.  Sendmail decides a next host or a de-
    livery agent by  the envelope sender address.  This database map is de-
    fined at the sendermt.m4, is referred in the sendermt ruleset.

zzz 
    Database map zzz defines  sleeping time of each sender, each recipient.
    Sendmail decides whether to delivery or not by using this database map.
    This database map is defined at sleeping_dictionary.m4,  is referred in
